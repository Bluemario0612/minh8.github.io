      <p> Everyone has special skills. I hope I will learn enough skills for building my own business. First, I want to learn about Web Design, Photoshop, and Computer Graphics. I love doing business and travelling so I will try to do my best to achieve my goals. Computer technology is one of the most important skills to me in this time; I feel the world changes so fast if I do not study about computer, I will be out of date and it is hard to find a good job.</p>
      <p>Besides that, I'm trying to read many books as possible to open my mind and knowledge.<b>"Rich Dad Poor Dad"</b> is one of my favorite books make me think about business and life in a different way. Therefore, I want to be good at technology and business to build my own business.</p>

        <dd>A Web developer is a kind of programmer who specializes in the development of applications relating to the World Wide Web or distributed network applications, which typically run protocols like HTTP from a Web server to a client browser using associated programming languages like HTML/CSS, C#, Ruby and PHP to name a few. A Web developer is usually concerned with the back end or the programming aspect of creating a website or Web application and is not to be confused with a Web designer, who only deals with the aesthetics of a website or application, although many professionals have both skill sets.
